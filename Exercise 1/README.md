# Exercise 1
This is a coding exercise and you can do it in the programming language you prefer. You are free to use the internet and any libraries you want.
Please use Jupyter Notebook to share your solution, but feel free to organize the code as you prefer (e.g. if you want you can write classes).
You have to choose between two tracks (please don't do both: only one will be evaluated): a regression problem and a classification problem.

## Customer churn prediction
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1

Objective: Build a binary classifier that predicts if a bankâ€™s customer is going to churn or not.

Your solution should address **at least** the following steps:
- Read the dataset and display columns.
- Analyze the data and state your observations.
- Select columns that are probably important to predict if a customer is going to churn (i.e., if a customer is stopping doing business with a company). You can also remove columns or create new ones, motivating your choices.
- Create training and test sets.
- Train a Machine Learning model to predict if a customer is going to churn.
- Evaluate your model on the test set, describing the metrics you are using and why you are using them. Comment on the results.

## Solution

The implementation of the solution is in the file `bank_churn.ipynb`. The file is a Python Notebook, so it can be opened with Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. The file contains the code and the comments to the code.
